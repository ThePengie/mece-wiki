# Pythagorean theorem
For a right triangle, $a^2+b^2=c^2$, where $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, the longest side opposing the right angle. $a, b$ represent the length of the two legs.

This is a very useful relationship that helps us find the missing side length of a right triangle and it comes up very freqently in Dynamics problems. 

## Simple trigonometry
 Using the same triangle in Figure 1, the [trigonometric functions](./trigonometry) $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$ are defined as below:

$$\sin\alpha=\frac{a}{c}, \cos\alpha=\frac{b}{c}, \tan\alpha=\frac{a}{b}$$

Based on the definition, it is obvious that $\sin(90^{\circ}-\alpha)=\cos\alpha$ and $\cos(90^{\circ}-\alpha)=\sin\alpha$.

This short video provides a quick summary of this segment and we usually only need $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$ as the other three can be calculated quickly from the three basics: [YouTube: Basic Trigonometry Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O74LFU4VmlE)

Please remember that these basic trigonometry equations are used extensively in Dynamics. Many quanties we encounter in Dynamics are vectors and decomposing vectors into appropriate coordinates is a key step to problem solving.
