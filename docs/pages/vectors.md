# Vectors
Vectors are mathematical constructs which contain **a set of values in a particular order**; the position of a particular value within the order of the set is called the *index*.  The total number of elements (individual values) in the set gives the *length* of the vector; the elements do NOT need to be unique.

Vectors are particularly **useful to represent situations or conditions which require collection of values to give a full description**, such as a position in 3D space.  This property makes them **ideal to represent many physical quantities, such as descriptions of forces in space or components of velocity, which have both a [magnitude](vectors#magnitude_and_direction_-euclidean_vectors-) and direction**.

Mathematically, vectors have the following properties:

* Vectors of the same length can be added and the sum is called the [resultant](vectors#vector-addition).
* Vectors of the same length can be [multiplied](vectors#vector-multiplication).
* Vectors can be scaled by [multiplication with scalar value](vectors#scalar-multiplication).
