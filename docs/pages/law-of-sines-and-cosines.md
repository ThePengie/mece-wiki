# Law of sines and cosines:
 Right triangles are not the only type of geometries we see. General triangles without right angles come up frequently. It is convenient to use laws of sines or cosines to resolve general triangles.

Using the triangle in Figure 1, law of sines: $$\frac{a}{\sin\alpha}=\frac{b}{\sin\beta}=\frac{c}{\sin\gamma}$$

Law of cosines: 
$$a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\cos\alpha$$
$$b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos\beta$$
$$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\gamma$$
