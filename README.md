# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Running the site locally

### Installation

```shell
npm install
```

### Local Development

```shell
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. If you want to test out the statically build content locally, you can use:

```shell\
npm run serve
```
